# Horiseon-Website-Refactoring

## Accessibilty Changes

Changes made to make website more accessible to users with assistive technologies ie screen readers

I added alt tags to images with and without content so assistive technologies will know what is redundant and what is not

Changed div syntax to section

Changed div with header class to just header

Changed title to "Main Page - Horiseon" to better indicate what page you are on for when future pages are implemented

## General Changes

Added missing "search-engine-optimization" class so link would direct to appropriate section

Added placeholder link to Horiseon in header so future pages can link back to the main page when implemented
