# Horiseon-Website-Refactoring

## Accessibilty Changes

Changes made to make website more accessible to users with assistive technologies ie screen readers
I added alt tags to <img>'s located in <div class="content">
Changed <div> syntax to <section>
Changed <div class="header"> to <header>
Changed <title> to Main Page - Horiseon to better indicate what page you are on for when future pages are implemented

## General Changes

Added missing "search-engine-optimization" class so link would direct to appropriate section
Added <a href="#"> as placeholder to Horiseon in <header> so future pages can link back to the main page when implemented
